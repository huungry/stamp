# Project on hold ðŸ”’
The project is currently on hold. The main goal to experiment with the tech stack has been satisfied.

---

# Stamp
Stamp is a loyalty stamp-collecting app designed for cafÃ© enthusiasts.

## Why?
The primary motivation for this project is to experiment with Scala stack. 

**This project is not production ready.** I use it to learn and experiment with different technologies and approaches.

## Tech Stack
- Scala 2.13
- Tapir
- Cats and Cats Effect
- Refined types
- Doobie
- Postgres
- Circe
- Pureconfig
- Chimney
- Embedded Postgres (based on [bootzooka](https://github.com/softwaremill/bootzooka))

## Usage
### Restaurant Employees and Owners
Restaurant owners and managers can configure stamp settings and establish the rewards that customers can earn. 
Additionally, they can authorize specific employees to scan visitors' QR codes for both stamp collection and reward redemption.

### CafÃ© Clients
Every time you visit your favorite cafÃ© and make a purchase, you have the option to show a QR code and earn a stamp. Accumulate enough stamps and you'll unlock rewards.
